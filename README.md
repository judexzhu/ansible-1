ansible
========

This is my collection of useful ansible playbooks.

It is (strongly) biased towards RedHat-likes (CentOS, specifically), and openSUSE.
No testing with debian-likes (or others, e.g. Arch) is done.

It started as a means of doing simple post-install housekeeping and hardening.
These are part of the common playbook (playbooks/common.yml), which is applied to all hosts by default.

All roles (will eventually) come with a README that details their functionality.
